<h1>The Best Movie According to Emmanuel</h1>
    <h2>My Top 3 Movies in the past Decade</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>The Courageous</h3>
    <p>This is a movie that potray the grave responsibily of a father. 
    <br> I understand from the movie that father should not be accidented but purposeful. 
    <br> Most children who lack the presence of a fatherly figure could turn out to be
    <br> anything and become the shadow of themselves.

    <h3>The Shrek</h3>
    <p>
        Every man at a point in his life gets to a fist! A point where hope seems defiled; <br>
        but right in the middle of that getting to have the encounter with your source and 
        <br>creator helps to refocus your heart and mind. 
        <br> There may not be an answer to every question but the revelattory knowledge brings the peace we desire.

    <h3>A Vow To Cherish</h3>
<p>
    To love is a beautiful thing but to live to be commited to that is great responsibily <br>
    We all profess the word LOVE but how many could live by that? <br>
    In this movie the faithfulness of a man cought my attention from that moment,<br>
    I MADE A VOW TO HONOR AND CHERIST THE ONE I MARRY.
